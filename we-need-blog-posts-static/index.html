        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I started this blog and found that, while my host <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> is rock-solid, having a live blog creates a whole mess of concerns about security and maintenance. I decided to do some research to see what kinds of ecosystems other bloggers put themselves in to obscure all the mess of server management. In searching for a better solution I stumbled down the "static blog generator" rabbit hole. </p>

<h4 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h4>

<p>First, I found <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a blog generator with direct integration into Github. This means you run Jekyll (probably locally, but maybe on a server), blog on it there, and then compile the pages into static files that get pushed to your GitHub. Jekyll's nice because your GitHub repo contains not only the static representations of your site but also the files Jekyll needs to work. That means you can clone your repo to any other machine with Jekyll installed and run it locally to add a new blog post or edit your templates. </p>

<p>Jekyll's popular, well-supported and integrates seamelssly with GitHub. What reasons do I have not to use it? Primarily - <em>I don't want to</em>. I wish I had a better reason, but I have a strong feeling about Ghost, and I trust my gut. Especially while I'm getting started and fighting to motivate myself to blog, I want to remain in the environment that I've enjoyed. </p>

<h4 id="buster">Buster</h4>

<p>So Jekyll's out for now. My continued searching brought me to an app called <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a>. Buster is a little app, written in Python, that takes the URL of your Ghost blog and converts it into static pages (hence, "Ghost" + "Buster". Get it? I was impressed). It gets rave reviews from its users and certainly seems to work well. Using Buster I was able to copy my blog from DigitalOcean over to a Github Pages site in about 5 minutes. </p>

<p>So Buster works fast, lets me keep using Ghost, and is easy to hack on. It would seem I've found my solution, right? Nope. I'm a nerd, and a textbook overthinker, and both of these facts played into me deciding that I don't want to use Buster because it's written in Python. What's wrong with Python? Not a thing. But Ghost is based on NodeJS, and since I like Javascript, I decided I could do one better than Buster.</p>

<h4 id="nodebuster">Node-Buster</h4>

<p>I started writing Node-Buster as a learning opportunity. I'm not a Python guru or anything but it's idiomatic enough for me to identify what Buster's doing and hack that functionality into a NodeJS app. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ATMartin/node-buster">Node-Buster</a> is absolutely a working name. I haven't given any well-due credit to Axshit Khurana for inspiring this, but I figure I'll clean up things like credit due, documentation and licensing when I've actually got a working product. </p>

<p>As it stands, Node-Buster will work - as long as you read the source code and can identify the right command-line arguments. I'm really working on converting it into an app more similar to <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo">Yo</a>, but for now I'm proud I can make it do anything. I haven't done much with Node, so this is a fun way to sharpen up my Javascript ability.</p>

<h4 id="wheretonext">Where to next?</h4>

<p>I'd really love to be skilled enough to integrate a static-page generation app into Ghost. I know Ghost is still young and I can't be the first person to think of this, so someone has probably already beaten me to that punch. I also know there are a ton of task runner and event-listener programs out that there that could just listen for new posts on my Ghost blog and automatically run everything I need to generate my pages on GitHub. It's definitely something I'd like to try, though, if only for the experience of following through on it. </p>

<p>I'm learning a little more every day. I'm working hard to motivate myself with small projects that challenge me. I'm enjoying my renewed focus on the dev world. </p>
