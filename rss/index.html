<p>I've been working on <a href='https://github.com/ATMartin/node-buster' >Node-Buster</a> for a week or so now, and I found an elegant fix togday I'm particularly proud/embarassed to share. </p>

<p>I want to be able to save sites/blogs/repositories in the app. Obviously I'm violating the good ol' <a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt' >YAGNI</a> principle here, but it's a feature I'd really like, and it's my app. Obviously, to persist these repos between app launches I'm going to need a datastore. Here's where my issue comes in: I think waaay too big. </p>

<p>I first started with SQL. I thought about getting Postgres running, but decided that a full-fledged DBMS would definitely be too large for this project. So then I moved to SQLite. I like SQLite and have used it in the past for small PHP test projects, but I've never used it on anything I'd actually put into production. I spent a couple days researching SQLite &amp; NodeJS interaction layers and found quite a few appealing ones. However, after those couple days I decided SQLite was more work than I wanted to put into this and I dropped it in favor of my next idea: YAML. </p>

<p>I haven't done a lot with <a href='http://www.yaml.org/' >YAML</a>, but I edited the occasional Minecraft data file using YAML and though it might be a simple way to store a persistent backend for my app. I found a great interaction layer for Node (<a href='https://github.com/jeremyfa/yaml.js' >yaml.js</a>) and got it hammered into Node-Buster. Everything was going great - I had overcome the issue and felt like a true problem solver! </p>

<p>It was over a day later when I realized my oversight. Let's see if you can spot it: </p>

<p>My workflow in the app is to store repos as Javascript objects inside an array. All editing and changes are made to the array in memory while the app runs. When changes are done, the app converts the JS object into Yaml, then writes it out to a .yaml file. When the app reopens and a request is made using the stored data, the app reads the .yaml file, converts it to a JS object, and loads it into a variable so it can be worked with. Rinse, repeat, ad nauseum. </p>

<p>See the issue here? I don't need Yaml. Javascript / Node provides a fantastic way to write out Javascript objects without any intermediary formatting or conversions. </p>

<p><strong>It's called JSON.</strong></p>

<p>I can write my objects directly out the .json files using Node's built-in JSON library. I can read/write files using Node's built-in FileSystem library. I don't need Yaml at all. It's just a middle-man that makes me feel like I'm doing things the "right" way. </p>

<p>Whoops! </p>

<p>I both love and hate the feeling I get when I face challenges like this. On one hand, I'm my greatest critic. I belittle myself for missing something that seems so obvious in retrospect, and that belittleing can often lead me to abandon a small project altogether because I come face to face with my own <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome' >Impostor Syndrome</a>. On the other hand, it's incredibly rewarding to find a simpler solution to an issue, and it makes me feel good that I'm getting advanced enough to see these kinds of mistakes. I know about myself that I tend to overthink things, but knowing is only half the battle - the other half is being aware of it and correcting it ahead of time. I tend to lose that second half. </p>

<p>Here's to hoping that sharing can help me get a little better about it.</p>]]></description><link>http://blog.atmartin.io/overthinking-it/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c2fe739b-6059-4e80-85e3-dcffa20f99b3</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Martin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2014 20:57:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[We need blog posts, stat(ic)!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I started this blog and found that, while my host <a href='http://www.digitalocean.com/' >DigitalOcean</a> is rock-solid, having a live blog creates a whole mess of concerns about security and maintenance. I decided to do some research to see what kinds of ecosystems other bloggers put themselves in to obscure all the mess of server management. In searching for a better solution I stumbled down the "static blog generator" rabbit hole. </p>

<h4 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h4>

<p>First, I found <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/' >Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a blog generator with direct integration into Github. This means you run Jekyll (probably locally, but maybe on a server), blog on it there, and then compile the pages into static files that get pushed to your GitHub. Jekyll's nice because your GitHub repo contains not only the static representations of your site but also the files Jekyll needs to work. That means you can clone your repo to any other machine with Jekyll installed and run it locally to add a new blog post or edit your templates. </p>

<p>Jekyll's popular, well-supported and integrates seamelssly with GitHub. What reasons do I have not to use it? Primarily - <em>I don't want to</em>. I wish I had a better reason, but I have a strong feeling about Ghost, and I trust my gut. Especially while I'm getting started and fighting to motivate myself to blog, I want to remain in the environment that I've enjoyed. </p>

<h4 id="buster">Buster</h4>

<p>So Jekyll's out for now. My continued searching brought me to an app called <a href='https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster' >Buster</a>. Buster is a little app, written in Python, that takes the URL of your Ghost blog and converts it into static pages (hence, "Ghost" + "Buster". Get it? I was impressed). It gets rave reviews from its users and certainly seems to work well. Using Buster I was able to copy my blog from DigitalOcean over to a Github Pages site in about 5 minutes. </p>

<p>So Buster works fast, lets me keep using Ghost, and is easy to hack on. It would seem I've found my solution, right? Nope. I'm a nerd, and a textbook overthinker, and both of these facts played into me deciding that I don't want to use Buster because it's written in Python. What's wrong with Python? Not a thing. But Ghost is based on NodeJS, and since I like Javascript, I decided I could do one better than Buster.</p>

<h4 id="nodebuster">Node-Buster</h4>

<p>I started writing Node-Buster as a learning opportunity. I'm not a Python guru or anything but it's idiomatic enough for me to identify what Buster's doing and hack that functionality into a NodeJS app. </p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/ATMartin/node-buster' >Node-Buster</a> is absolutely a working name. I haven't given any well-due credit to Axshit Khurana for inspiring this, but I figure I'll clean up things like credit due, documentation and licensing when I've actually got a working product. </p>

<p>As it stands, Node-Buster will work - as long as you read the source code and can identify the right command-line arguments. I'm really working on converting it into an app more similar to <a href='https://github.com/yeoman/yo' >Yo</a>, but for now I'm proud I can make it do anything. I haven't done much with Node, so this is a fun way to sharpen up my Javascript ability.</p>

<h4 id="wheretonext">Where to next?</h4>

<p>I'd really love to be skilled enough to integrate a static-page generation app into Ghost. I know Ghost is still young and I can't be the first person to think of this, so someone has probably already beaten me to that punch. I also know there are a ton of task runner and event-listener programs out that there that could just listen for new posts on my Ghost blog and automatically run everything I need to generate my pages on GitHub. It's definitely something I'd like to try, though, if only for the experience of following through on it. </p>

<p>I'm learning a little more every day. I'm working hard to motivate myself with small projects that challenge me. I'm enjoying my renewed focus on the dev world. </p>]]></description><link>http://blog.atmartin.io/we-need-blog-posts-static/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">7a61a9e5-7b6c-467f-97e3-40cac7d64878</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Martin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2014 20:37:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Homebrew & your PATH]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>This is an addendum to my <a href='http://blog.atmartin.io/engines-ready-0-to-dev-on-osx-10-9-mavericks/' >previous post</a> addressing the most common error I see with new <a href='http://brew.sh/' >Homebrew</a> installations.</em></p>

<p>Try something with me: type <code>echo $PATH</code> into your terminal and press enter. See all that mess that comes out? That's your <code>PATH</code>: a list of directories that your terminal expects to contain any command you might ever use. If you're a more file-oriented person, you can find your operating system's default PATH implementation by opening <code>/etc/paths</code> with your favorite text editor (careful - don't edit it!). </p>

<p>When you submit a command, say <code>git --version</code>, your computer searches each of those directories in the order they're listed until it finds a program called <code>git</code>. It then asks <code>git</code> what to do with <code>--version</code>. <code>git</code> will take whatever it's handed by the OS, process it, and return its output to your terminal for you to do with as you please.</p>

<p>This can cause an issue when you have multiple versions of software on your system. Imagine you have two versions of Git and your PATH looks like this: <code>/old/git:/new/git</code>. No matter how often you update that <code>/new/git</code>, the <code>/old/git</code> will always be used since it shows up first. </p>

<p>The common way to fix this is by appending newer directories to the front of your PATH, like this:  </p>

<pre><code>    export PATH="/new/dir/route:$PATH"
</code></pre>

<p>This sets your PATH as equal to the new directory followed by your original PATH list. </p>

<p>The first time you run <code>brew doctor</code>, you'll probably see an error regarding <code>/usr/bin</code> &amp; your PATH. If you see this error, run the following command in your terminal:  </p>

<pre><code>    'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; source ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<p>This will ensure your terminal checks Homebrew's installed &amp; updated apps before it checks an older &amp; possibly outdated folder. </p>

<p>This directive is written to the <code>.bash_profile</code> file in your home directory. If you need to remove it later, open <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and delete the command. <strong>Do be careful</strong> - your profile will probably contain lots of other nuts &amp; bolts and if you're using this tutorial you may not yet know what it all means. </p>

<p><em>If you're a purist regarding your PATH, or if you need support for the older XCode versions of certain programs, take a look at <a href='http://superuser.com/questions/324616/how-should-i-set-the-path-variable-on-my-mac-so-the-hombrew-installed-tools-are/580611' #580611">this answer on SuperUser</a>. This is a much more complicated solution than I need, but it may help you if defaulting to Homebrew's versions causes issues on your system.</em></p>

Sadly, this step trips many newcomers up. Documentation is spread all over and many sources are out of date or otherwise unusable for a new developer. </p>

<p>I hope to keep this up-to-date as a simple walkthrough for how I set new machines up. Hopefully it can help someone else out, too.</p>

<p>We'll be installing all the following software on a fresh &amp; clean OSX Mavericks format:</p>

<ul>
<li>XCode</li>
<li>Homebrew</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>RVM</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have trouble, either with an installation or with following along, <a href='http://twitter.com/ADotMartin' >drop me a line</a>!</p>

<h3 id="xcode">XCode</h3>

<p><a href='https://developer.apple.com/xcode/' >XCode</a> is a massive package from Apple including commonly-used libraries and an IDE for iOS &amp; OSX development. The IDE isn't necessary unless you're planning on building iOS apps or Mac desktop apps, but many of the libraries are mandatory for development. Thakfully, Apple released the XCode Command Line Tools package to allow developers without the need for their XCode IDE to get the packages they need. </p>

<p>A lot of people will have XCode installed without even knowing it. If you're not on a fresh install, run the following command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ xcode-select -p
</code></pre>

<p>If you see anything other than a filepath (like <code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/</code>), you need to install XCode. </p>

<p>Apple was also nice enough to create an automated installer for the XCode CLT. If you try to run any command that needs XCode (try <code>git</code>) and it's not installed, you'll see the following prompt:</p>

<p><img src='http://blog.atmartin.io/content/images/2014/Sep/xcode-prompt-1.png'  alt="XCode Prompt" /></p>

<p>If you think you'll be doing Apple-specific development in the near future (ie: iPhone, iPad, Mac native apps), click on the "Get XCode" button to get the full package. WARNING - it's big. If you're planning on doing web development, or just want a quicker setup experience, click on the "Install" button. You'll have to except an EULA, and then XCode will do its thing and install its command line tools on your machine.</p>

<p>Of course, if this has all been too much for you already, you can click "Not Now". XCode will still be here when you're done on Facebook.</p>

<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h3>

<p><a href='http://brew.sh/' >Homebrew</a> is a package manager for OSX, and provides similar functionality to <code>apt-get</code> or <code>yum</code> on Linux systems. It maintains a library of commonly-sought applications accesible by shortcut names and makes it a breeze to install, upgrade and remove them as desired. It's not necessary, but it's SUPER helpful! You'll get quickly tired of looking up download repositories without it.</p>

<p>To install, open a new terminal and run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</code></pre>

<p>This pulls the Homebrew install script from their GitHub and runs it using Ruby on your machine. Thankfully, a Ruby build is installed by default on newer versions of OSX! </p>

<p>Homebrew will take a few minutes to install and may require you to enter your password or monitor another installation. Be patient, and when it's done, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew doctor
</code></pre>

<p>This is a helpful utility that will check your Homebrew setup to make sure everything's smooth. If you get any response other than <code>Your system is ready to brew</code>, check <a href='http://blog.atmartin.io/homebrew-and-your-path/' >this post</a> out to see a quick fix for the most common Homebrew error. If that's not the fix for you, head to Google with your warning text in hand.</p>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>

<p>Now that we have Homebrew, life's a breeze! To install the latest version of <a href='http://git-scm.com/' >Git</a>, simply run:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install git
</code></pre>

<p>Wait a minute for Homebrew to work its magic and then ensure your Git installed correctly with</p>

<pre><code>$ git --version
</code></pre>

<p>You should get a reply of <code>git version 2.1.0</code> or later.</p>

<p>NOTE: If your git version shows as lower than <code>2.1.0</code>, take a look at my <a href='http://blog.atmartin.io/homebrew-and-your-path/' >Homebrew &amp; your PATH</a> post.</p>

<h3 id="rvm">RVM</h3>

<p><a href='http://rvm.io/' >Ruby Version Manager</a> is an invaluable utility for managing Ruby &amp; Rails installations. For a hobbyist it's a good way to make sure your Ruby &amp; Rails stays up to date. For serious development, it lets you test your apps against older versions of Ruby and lets your create custom environments to test in so you don't ruin your production app with sandbox code.</p>

<p>To install RVM (and the latest Ruby &amp; Rails versions), run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code> $ curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails --autolibs=homebrew
</code></pre>

<p>When installation finishes, RVM will ask you to run another command, something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ source /Users/yourname/.rvm/scripts/rvm
</code></pre>

<p><strong>MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS</strong>. This will add RVM to your PATH so you can use it from your terminal. </p>

<p>After both your installation and the secondary script have run, close your current Terminal instance, restart Terminal, and try both <code>ruby -v</code> and <code>rails -v</code>. Your versions should be <code>2.1.2</code> and <code>4.1.6</code> or greater.</p>

<h3 id="readyforbattle">Ready for Battle!</h3>

<p>With these pieces in place, my computer's a lean mean coding machine! To finalize, I'll install a graphical text editor (I recommend <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/' >Sublime Text</a> or <a href='https://atom.io/' >Atom</a>) and Google's Chrome browser for debugging. I'll also add my dotfiles to make things a little prettier - I'll share some prompt setup tips later on. </p>

I'm Alex (sometimes Lex) and I want to build software.</h4>

<p>I grew up in a tech-centric family. My parents were both educators but my dad moved into tech administration early on in his career and my mom became the de-facto "computer person" at every school she taught at. Their combined experience and knowledge rubbed off on me, and from my first green-screen Apple to my slew of gadgets today I've been breaking things to get a better idea of how they work. </p>

<p>I've set for myself the goal of <em>being proficient at developing simple software from scratch</em>. I say "simple" because I don't believe complexity defines quality. I say "scratch" because I don't believe <code>rails generate scaffold Blog</code> makes you an engineer. </p>

<p>I've lurked in the development ecosystem most of my life but I know it's important for me to become more active. I want to contirubte but I need both the chops and the confidence to do so. I'm starting this blog to, in part, make myself more accountable. </p>

<p>I hope to share some of my projects, both completed and in-progress, here, as well as any nifty discoveries I make while learning.</p>
